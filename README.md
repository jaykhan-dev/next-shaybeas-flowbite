# Shaybeas Enterprises

## Project Overview

[See Prototype made with NEXT JS](https://next-shaybeas.vercel.app)

This project is a remake of an earlier marketing site I created for a client which was made with Webflow. By using Next JS for the new version, I have found several benefits in writing code rather than using a proprietary software.

Currently, there is no database which means there is no search functionality or API requests. This prototype is essentially a Proof-of-Concept. It is setup on Github so that any developer can make a pull request to add more functionality. Since Vercel handles all the hosting infrastructure, a HTTPS security is provided when you deploy a project.

## Why Next JS?

The following reasons sum up why I chose Next JS to recreate a marketing site.

1. The right open source softwares tend to be of higher quality because of community input rather than a core of elite developers who may or may not stick around. Great examples of successful open source software include Linux, Bitcoin, and React/Next JS.
2. Being able to customize every aspect of the site or app depends on your knowledge and skill rather than a paid subscription that unlocks all the tools. In other words, there is more freedom.
3. Fast load times because of Static Site Generation which loads pages from a CDN or the Edge network. This results in a better User Experience.
4. The ability to use Server Side Rendering for more complex, dynamic user interfaces which require connecting to an API.

Overall the development experience is positive and efficient. My focus is strictly on creating user interfaces and Next JS provides a great way of doing that.
